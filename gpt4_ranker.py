    simple_prompt = f"""You are ranking {len(valid_images)} images from a water well project for donor appeal.

{input_validation}

{history_context}

You must assign a **priority score** to each image from 1 (lowest donor appeal) to {len(valid_images)} (highest donor appeal), using each number exactly once.

ðŸ“Š DETAILED RANKING GUIDE (Donor Visual Preference):

ðŸ¥‡ 10/10 â€” Plaque fully readable with donor name + joyful children in front holding water containers, excellent framing and lighting.  
ðŸ¥ˆ 9/10 â€” Happy children playing with or splashing water; very lively, natural joy, good clarity.  
ðŸ¥‰ 8/10 â€” Children operating the pump with clear water flow and happy expressions, medium-range framing.  
7/10 â€” Children actively filling pots from the pump; visible water and full-body shots, slightly less vibrant.  
6/10 â€” Kids drinking and filling simultaneously, joyful but cluttered or minor visibility issues.  
5/10 â€” Drinking from hands or group joy, but lighting or focus not optimal.  
4/10 â€” Mixed engagement; some expressions unclear or partially blocked subjects.  
3/10 â€” Pumping and drinking scene with dispersed subjects, plaque partially cut off.  
2/10 â€” Large group image with minimal interaction or emotional expression, plaque distant.  
1/10 â€” Children sitting or praying near the well; no water activity, static or subdued composition.

ðŸ“Œ TIP: Donor appeal is highest when:
- Plaque is clearly visible with donor name.
- Children look happy and actively use the well.
- Water flow is visible.
- The scene feels authentic, clean, and emotionally uplifting.

Respond with ONLY a JSON array using the EXACT IDs and filenames from the validation list above:
[
  {{"id": "{valid_images[0]['id']}", "filename": "{valid_images[0]['filename']}", "priority": 1, "reason": "Short reason"}},
  {{"id": "{valid_images[1]['id'] if len(valid_images) > 1 else 'EXAMPLE_ID'}", "filename": "{valid_images[1]['filename'] if len(valid_images) > 1 else 'EXAMPLE_FILENAME'}", "priority": 2, "reason": "Short reason"}}
]

ðŸ”’ VALIDATION: Ensure every result uses an exact ID and filename from the list. Use each priority number 1-{len(valid_images)} once, with no duplicates or missing numbers."""
